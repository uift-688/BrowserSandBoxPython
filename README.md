# Pyodide-in-Chrome Python Runner

This project allows you to run Pyodide inside Chrome and control it via Selenium, effectively creating a remotely controllable Python interpreter in the browser.

## Overview

- Uses **Pyodide** to execute Python code within the browser (Chrome).
- Controlled via **Selenium WebDriver**.
- Designed to act as a headless or interactive Python interpreter through browser automation.
- Ideal for automation, testing, scripting, or remote execution of Python code.

## Usage

1. **Download and run the `runtime.exe` file** to launch a Pyodide-enabled browser window.
2. **Wait for the browser to fully load** â€” please note that this may take a few moments as the browser needs to initialize Pyodide.
3. **Control the Pyodide instance using Selenium** to send Python code and receive results.

The browser window will act as a Python interpreter that can be controlled programmatically through Selenium.
